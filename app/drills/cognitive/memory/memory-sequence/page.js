    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a sequence memory test?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A sequence memory test measures your working memory capacity for serial order — the ability to remember not just what stimuli appeared, but the exact chronological order they were presented. It is one of the most widely used and well-validated memory assessments, with variants including the Digit Span, Corsi Block Test, and the popular Simon electronic game." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does this sequence memory game work?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The game displays a sequence of colored or spatial cues in a specific order. After each display, you must reproduce the exact sequence by clicking the cues in the same order. Each successful round adds one more item to the sequence, gradually expanding the length until you make a mistake. Your final sequence length is your working memory span score." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the average sequence memory score?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The average human working memory span is 7 ± 2 items (Miller's Law, 1956). For spatial sequence tasks specifically, most adults can accurately reproduce sequences of 5-7 steps. Scores above 9 indicate above-average working memory capacity, and scores of 12+ are in the exceptional range seen in memory athletes and trained professionals." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the chimp test and how does it compare to this?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Chimp Test (from Human Benchmark) shows numbers on a grid, then covers them, and asks you to tap the positions in order. It famously showed that chimpanzees outperform humans on this specific sequential recall task. This sequence memory game tests similar working memory capacity but with expanding visual pattern sequences rather than numbered grids." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How can I improve my sequence memory?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Effective strategies include: (1) Chunking — grouping sequences into pairs or triplets (e.g., 'red-blue, green-blue, red-green' as two chunks), (2) Verbal rehearsal — silently naming each position as it lights up, (3) Spatial anchoring — mentally mapping sequence positions to a familiar location, (4) Regular practice — consistent rehearsal strengthens phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad capacity over time." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the Corsi Block Test?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Corsi Block Test (1972) is a validated neuropsychological tool measuring visuospatial working memory. A clinician taps blocks in a sequence, and the patient must tap them in the same order. The longest sequence correctly recalled is the 'Corsi Span.' This online sequence game is based on the same underlying memory mechanism but presented digitally." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the difference between visual and auditory sequence memory?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Visual sequence memory (visuospatial sketchpad) stores spatial positions and patterns. Auditory sequence memory (phonological loop) retains sounds, words, and spoken sequences. These are two separate but complementary subsystems of Baddeley's working memory model. This test primarily challenges visuospatial sequence recall, though auditory feedback cues also engage phonological processing." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Does the Simon Says game actually improve memory?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Research on dual n-back training and sequence memory training consistently shows improvements in working memory span, processing speed, and attention with regular practice. The Simon paradigm specifically trains rapid sequential encoding, active rehearsal, and ordered recall — all of which generalize to real-world tasks involving following instructions, learning procedures, and music performance." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a good digit span score?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Digit Span is a similar test using numbers. Normal adult forward digit span is 5-9 digits. For the WAIS-IV intelligence test, a raw score of 8-9 is average for adults (90-110 IQ range). Memory athletes using the 'Major System' mnemonic technique can achieve spans of 50+ digits by converting numbers to meaningful words and scenes." }

    {
      "@type": "Question",

      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. The Sequence Memory Test on SkillDrills is completely free. No registration, no downloads, and no subscriptions required. It is directly comparable to Human Benchmark's sequence memory test but with additional visual feedback, training modes, and performance tracking." }
