      "name": "What is the Tower of Hanoi puzzle?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle consisting of three pegs and a set of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from the first peg to the third peg, following these rules: (1) only one disk can be moved at a time, (2) only the top disk of any stack can be moved, and (3) a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk." }

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do you solve the Tower of Hanoi?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The recursive solution: To move n disks from peg A to peg C, using peg B as auxiliary: (1) Move n-1 disks from A to B (using C as auxiliary), (2) Move the largest disk from A to C, (3) Move n-1 disks from B to C (using A as auxiliary). For a non-recursive approach: alternate between moving the smallest disk to the next peg and making the only legal non-smallest-disk move available." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the minimum number of moves to solve Tower of Hanoi?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The minimum number of moves required is 2ⁿ - 1, where n is the number of disks. Examples: 3 disks = 7 moves, 4 disks = 15 moves, 5 disks = 31 moves, 6 disks = 63 moves, 7 disks = 127 moves, 8 disks = 255 moves. Any solution using more moves than this minimum is suboptimal." }

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What cognitive skills does Tower of Hanoi train?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Tower of Hanoi is frequently used in neuropsychological assessment and cognitive training because it requires: (1) Planning ahead — mentally sequencing future moves before executing them, (2) Subgoal decomposition — breaking a complex goal into manageable sub-problems, (3) Working memory — holding multiple disk positions and constraints simultaneously, (4) Inhibitory control — resisting the urge to make the 'obvious' wrong move, and (5) Recursive thinking — applying the same solution strategy at smaller scales." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is Tower of Hanoi related to recursion in programming?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Tower of Hanoi is the canonical introductory example of recursion in computer science. The solution naturally expresses itself as a recursive function: hanoi(n, from, to, aux). It perfectly demonstrates that some problems are most elegantly solved by a function that calls itself on a smaller version of the same problem. Computer science students worldwide first encounter recursion through Tower of Hanoi." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the history of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Tower of Hanoi was invented by French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883. He published it under the pseudonym N. Claus de Siam and accompanied it with a legend about Vietnamese monks in Hanoi solving a 64-disk puzzle — which would require 2⁶⁴ - 1 ≈ 18 quintillion moves and take approximately 585 billion years at one move per second." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How is Tower of Hanoi used in psychology and neuroscience?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Tower of Hanoi and Tower of London tests are standard neuropsychological tools for assessing executive function — specifically planning, problem-solving, and goal-directed sequencing. Deficits on Tower tasks are associated with frontal lobe damage, Parkinson's disease, ADHD, and schizophrenia. The puzzle measures the 'depth of planning' the prefrontal cortex can support." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What strategy helps you solve Tower of Hanoi faster?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Key strategies: (1) Think 2-3 moves ahead before moving any disk, (2) Focus on getting the largest unplaced disk to its destination peg — the rest follows naturally, (3) Practice the 3-disk version until it's automatic — this builds muscle memory for the recursive structure that scales to larger puzzles, (4) Use the alternating-move pattern for even numbers of disks." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can Tower of Hanoi improve executive function and planning skills?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Research shows that training on Tower of Hanoi-style tasks improves look-ahead planning, working memory capacity, and response inhibition. These improvements transfer to real-world planning tasks, as the skill of breaking complex multi-step goals into optimal sequences is domain-general and applicable in engineering, management, medicine, and daily decision-making." }
