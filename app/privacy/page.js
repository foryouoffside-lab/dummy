        <Section title="Overview">
          <p>SkillDrills ("we", "us") provides free training drills at skilldrills.online and a companion SkillDrills mobile app. This policy explains what information we collect across the website and the app, why we collect it, and how you can control or delete it.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Information we collect">
          <p><strong className="text-slate-300">Using our website.</strong> You can use skilldrills.online and play drills without creating an account. We use Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights to understand traffic and page performance — these are cookie-less and don't collect personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-slate-300">Account information (mobile app).</strong> Signing in to the SkillDrills app requires a Google account. We receive your name, email address, and profile photo from Google Sign-In to create your player profile.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-slate-300">Gameplay data (mobile app).</strong> Drill scores, streaks, XP/level progress, and daily challenge history are stored against your account so your progress is saved and can sync across sessions.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-slate-300">Diagnostic data (mobile app).</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect crash reports and basic device information (device model, OS version, app version) so we can find and fix bugs. This data is not linked to your name or used for advertising.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-slate-300">Usage analytics (mobile app).</strong> The app uses Firebase Analytics to understand which drills and features are actually used — screen views and events like completing a drill (drill, category, score). It doesn't use cookies or track you across other websites or apps, and isn't used for advertising.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-slate-300">Device preferences (mobile app).</strong> Settings like sound on/off are stored locally on your device only and are never sent to us.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="How we use this information">
          <p>To operate the website and app, save and display your progress, personalize daily challenges, keep things working correctly, and diagnose bugs and performance issues. We do not run ads and we do not sell your personal information to anyone.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Who we share data with">
          <p>The app's data is stored using Firebase (Google Cloud) as our backend infrastructure provider, and diagnostic/usage data is processed by Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics as described above. The website's traffic and performance data is processed by Vercel. These providers process data on our behalf under their own security and data-processing terms — we do not sell or share your data with anyone else, including advertisers.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Data retention & deletion">
          <p>We keep your app account data for as long as your account exists. You can permanently delete your account and all associated data at any time from <span className="text-slate-300">Progress → Delete Account &amp; Wipe Data</span> inside the app. If you no longer have the app installed, email <span className="text-slate-300">skilldrills.contact@gmail.com</span> from the address associated with your account and we'll delete your data within 30 days.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Children's privacy">
          <p>SkillDrills is not directed at children under 13, and creating an app account requires a Google account. If we become aware that we've collected information from a child under 13 without appropriate consent, we will delete it — contact us below to request this.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Security">
          <p>App sign-in is handled entirely by Google — we never see or store your password. Your data is protected using Firebase's standard authentication and access-control rules.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Changes to this policy">
          <p>If this policy changes, we'll update the date at the top of this page. Continued use of SkillDrills after a change means you accept the updated policy.</p>
        </Section>
