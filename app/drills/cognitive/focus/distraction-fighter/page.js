    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why are humans so easily distracted?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Humans have an evolved orienting reflex that automatically directs attention toward novel, moving, or salient stimuli — a survival mechanism to detect threats and opportunities. In modern environments, this reflex is constantly triggered by notifications, movement, and bright colors, undermining voluntary focus. Training inhibitory control helps you override this reflex." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the Stroop test and how does it measure distraction resistance?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Stroop test (1935) requires naming the ink color of color words printed in conflicting colors (e.g., the word 'RED' in blue ink). The interference between the automatic reading response and the voluntary color-naming response measures your cognitive inhibition strength. A longer reaction time or more errors indicates stronger Stroop interference — weaker distraction resistance." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is inhibitory control and why does it matter?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Inhibitory control is the executive function that suppresses automatic, habitual, or impulse-driven responses in favor of more deliberate, goal-directed actions. It is essential for resisting distractions, suppressing irrelevant memories, controlling impulsive behavior, and maintaining task focus. It is one of the three core executive functions alongside working memory and cognitive flexibility." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How can I train my brain to block out distractions?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Effective methods include: (1) Stroop test and Flanker task practice (strengthens top-down inhibitory pathways), (2) mindfulness meditation (increases prefrontal cortex gray matter density), (3) single-tasking practice (training sustained focus without device interruptions), and (4) progressive exposure to distractor-rich environments during deliberate practice. This drill provides direct gamified inhibitory control exercise." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the Flanker task and how does it relate to distraction?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Eriksen Flanker Task displays a central target surrounded by congruent (same direction) or incongruent (opposite direction) flanker stimuli. The incongruent condition creates response competition — your brain must inhibit the incorrect flanker response to respond correctly to the central target. This resistance to flanker distraction is precisely what this game trains." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can distraction-resistance training help with open-office productivity?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Workers in open offices face continuous visual and auditory distractors. Training inhibitory control makes it cognitively cheaper to suppress peripheral visual movement (colleagues walking), auditory interruptions, and environmental noise, allowing deeper sustained focus during critical work intervals." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the orienting reflex and how does it cause distraction?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The orienting reflex is an automatic neurological response to novel stimuli — your brain involuntarily redirects attention to unexpected sounds, movement, or visual changes. Mediated by the superior colliculus and thalamus, it evolved to ensure threat detection. Inhibitory control training helps the prefrontal cortex override this reflex when distraction is unhelpful." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does this distraction fighter game work?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The game presents a primary target task while simultaneously spawning deceptive visual distractors. You must successfully complete your primary task while resisting clicking or responding to the distractors. Each successful distractor resistance builds your inhibitory control score, while each distractor click counts as an impulse control failure." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Does inhibitory control training help children with ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Inhibitory control deficits are a hallmark of ADHD. Computerized inhibitory control training shows promise as a supplemental intervention, with studies showing improvements in stop-signal reaction times, Stroop interference, and classroom behavior with regular practice. Always combine cognitive training with clinical treatment and professional guidance." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is this distraction-fighter game free to play?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. The Distraction Fighter drill on SkillDrills is completely free. No sign-up, no downloads, no subscriptions. It runs entirely in your browser on both desktop and mobile devices." }
